Overview

Task description:

This assessment task requires you to create an audio-visual presentation on one of the topics allocated on this spreadsheet: Topic Allocation

See announcements for details of how the topic allocation  process works.

Unit Learning Outcomes assessed:

ULO 3: Conduct independent research relating to new parallel hardware and new parallel programming frameworks.

ULO 4: Deliver an effective, professional presentation to a specialist audience.

ULO 5:  Critique alternative parallel programming technologies
What you need to do

You need to start by finding your topic from the above list. Your task is to research that topic and to create an audio-visual presentation for the class. This will consist of a video (mp4 file) plus accompanying slides (submitted as a pdf file). The video needs to show the slides with your audio narration. It does not need to include your face, but it can if you wish. It may include demos, but be mindful of not wasting valuable time. The strict maximum duration of the video is 10 minutes. Anything beyond that duration will not be accepted.

Obviously in just 10 minutes you will not be able to present a comprehensive how-to tutorial on detailed aspects of the language or system in question. Your goal is to present a balanced high-level overview and introduction to that topic. Your presentation should include the following:

    A brief Acknowledgement of Country (1 mark) (see https://www.reconciliation.org.au/reconciliation/acknowledgement-of-country-and-welcome-to-country 

    Links to an external site. for advice). This introduction does not count towards your 10 minute time limit.
    Overview (8 marks) - Provide the audience with an excellent feel for what it would be like to program using that system. Show us some code! You
    should include parallelization of matrix multiply (where possible) as an example of using your programming language/framework/tool so that we can easily compare it relative to other languages/frameworks/tools. Your example should show the code, explain the language mechanisms used and the parallel speedup achieved relative to the best sequential implementation on the same hardware.
    Context (3 marks) - Place your programming language/framework/tool in context with relation to other parallelization technologies. What is the basic programming model? For example, does it give the illusion of a globally accessible shared memory or does the programmer need to explicitly map data to a distributed memory? What kinds of applications and/or computer systems is this system typically used for? What is its history? Have there been new versions released recently? How popular is it? Is it proprietary or an open standard? Are there multiple vendors? Is it free to obtain? Who controls its specification?
    Critique (2 marks) - What other languages/systems is it similar to? How is it different? What are its main strengths/weaknesses compared to
    other systems? Try to include your own insightful analysis and critique.
    Q&A (3 marks) â€“ During the Lectures and Tutorials from week 5 onwards there will be a question and answer session for the student presentations allocated to that week. During those Q&A sessions the lecturer, tutors and students will ask questions and the students who researched those topics will have the opportunity to try to answer those questions.

 
What to submit

You need to submit precisely 2 files via CAB401 Assignment 1 - Audio Visual Presentation : Submission Page

    An MP4 video file of at most 10 minutes duration showing your slides with audio narration. Including a live demo or your face in the top corner is entirely optional.
    A PDF file containing your slides. 

Note: the best videos on each topic will be shared with the rest of the class as part of the learning materials (for this semester only). 

See Announcements for advice on how to capture MP4 video recording of your presentation.

Unlimited submissions are allowed, with only the last version graded. 

If you have any questions, please ask via MS Teams Presentation channel.

Feedback:

The presentations will be marked (and feedback provided) after you've completed the Q&A for your presentation which will happen progressively throughout the semester.

Moderation:

All staff who are assessing your work meet to discuss and compare their judgements before marks or grades are finalised.
